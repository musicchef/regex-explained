# Explaining a Regex for Matching URLs

## Summary

In this document, we'll explore a regular expression (regex) designed to match URLs. The regex is `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`. We'll break down this regex into its individual components, explaining their roles and how they work together to validate and extract parts of a URL.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In the regex `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`, the `^` and `$` are anchors.

- `^` asserts the start of the string, ensuring that the match begins at the beginning of the input.
- `$` asserts the end of the string, ensuring that the match extends to the end of the input.

These anchors collectively define the boundaries of the URL.

### Quantifiers

The quantifiers in this regex are `?`, `*`, and `{2,6`.

- `?` makes the preceding `s?` (https) group optional. This allows URLs to have either `http://` or `https://`, or none at all.
- `*` allows the preceding `([\/\w \.-]*)*` to match zero or more characters within the path part of the URL.
- `{2,6}` specifies the allowed length for the top-level domain (TLD) part of the URL. It matches domains with 2 to 6 characters (e.g., .com, .net, .info).

### Grouping Constructs

This regex uses several grouping constructs to capture different parts of the URL:

- `(https?:\/\/)?` captures the optional protocol part (e.g., `http://` or `https://`).
- `([\da-z\.-]+)` captures the domain name, including letters, digits, periods, and hyphens.
- `([a-z\.]{2,6})` captures the TLD (e.g., .com, .net).
- `([\/\w \.-]*)*` captures the optional path part of the URL.

### Bracket Expressions

The regex contains square brackets `[...]` within character classes:

- `[\da-z\.-]` matches digits, lowercase letters, periods, and hyphens.

### Character Classes

Character classes like `\d` and `\w` are used to match specific character types:

- `\d` matches digits (0-9).
- `\w` matches word characters (letters, digits, and underscores).

### The OR Operator

The `|` symbol is used to denote an OR operation. For example, `https?` matches either "http" or "https."

### Flags

The regex doesn't use any flags like `/g`, `/i`, or `/m`.

### Character Escapes

The regex doesn't contain any character escapes.
